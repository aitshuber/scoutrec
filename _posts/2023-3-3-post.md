We've also learned that when the culture of sharing is brought in earlier, the better teams adapt and communicate with one another.</p><p>That's why we are excited to share that we now have a <a class="link" href="#">free version of Front</a>, which will allow individual designers, startups and other small teams a chance to create a culture of openness early on.</p><!-- Blockquote --><p>We know the power of sharing is real, and we want to create an opportunity for everyone to try Front and explore how transformative open communication can be. Now you can have a team of one or two designers and unlimited spectators (think PMs, management, marketing, etc.) share work and explore the design process earlier.</p><ul class="list-py-2"><li>Front allows us to collaborate in real time and is a really great way for leadership on the team to stay up-to-date with what everybody is working on," <a class="link" href="#">said</a> Stewart Scott-Curran, Intercom's Director of Brand Design.</li><li>Front opened a new way of sharing.

Front allows you to invite more people into the process, creating a central place for conversation around design. As those teams grow, transparency and collaboration becomes integrated in how they communicate and work together. <a class="btn btn-ghost-secondary btn-sm btn-icon rounded-circle me-2" href="#"> </a> <a class="btn btn-ghost-secondary btn-sm btn-icon rounded-circle me-2" href="#"> </a> <a class="btn btn-ghost-secondary btn-sm btn-icon rounded-circle me-2" href="#"> </a> <a class="btn btn-ghost-secondary btn-sm btn-icon rounded-circle me-2" href="#"> </a></p><!-- Card --><div class="row justify-content-sm-between align-items-sm-center mt-5"><!-- End Col --><div class="col-sm-auto"> </div><!-- End Col --></div><!-- End Row --></div></div>
