We've always believed that by providing a space where designers can share ongoing work not only empowers them to make better products, it also helps them grow. We're proud to be a part of creating a more open culture and to continue building a product that supports this vision.</p></div><div class="my-4 my-sm-8"><img class="img-fluid rounded-lg" alt="Image Description" src="./assets/img/1920x800/img5.jpg" /></div><div class="w-lg-65 mx-lg-auto"><p>As we've grown, we've seen how Front has helped companies such as Spotify, Microsoft, Airbnb, Facebook, and Intercom bring their designers closer together to create amazing things. We've also learned that when the culture of sharing is brought in earlier, the better teams adapt and communicate with one another.</p><p>That's why we are excited to share that we now have a <a class="link" href="#">free version of Front</a>, which will allow individual designers, startups and other small teams a chance to create a culture of openness early on.</p><!-- Blockquote --><figure class="bg-light text-center p-7 my-7"><blockquote class="blockquote blockquote-lg">" I love Front!

Now you can have a team of one or two designers and unlimited spectators (think PMs, management, marketing, etc.) share work and explore the design process earlier.</p><ul class="list-py-2"><li>Front allows us to collaborate in real time and is a really great way for leadership on the team to stay up-to-date with what everybody is working on," <a class="link" href="#">said</a> Stewart Scott-Curran, Intercom's Director of Brand Design.</li><li>Front opened a new way of sharing. It's a persistent way for everyone to see and absorb each other's work," said David Scott, Creative Director at <a class="link" href="#">Eventbrite</a>.</li></ul></div><div class="my-4 my-sm-8"><img class="img-fluid rounded-lg" alt="Image Description" src="./assets/img/1920x800/img6.jpg" /></div><div class="w-lg-65 mx-lg-auto"><p>Small teams and individual designers need a space where they can watch the design process unfold, both for themselves and for the people they work with – no matter if it's a fellow designer, product manager, developer or client. Front allows you to invite more people into the process, creating a central place for conversation around design. As those teams grow, transparency and collaboration becomes integrated in how they communicate and work together.</p><!-- Card --><div class="card bg-dark text-center my-4" style="background-image: url(./assets/svg/components/wave-pattern-light.svg);"><div class="card-body"><h4 class="text-white mb-4">Like what you're reading?
