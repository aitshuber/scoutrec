We are excited to announce that Scout Real Estate Co. is making a big move! Starting September 11, 2024, our new office will be located at **617 S Buchanan St, Downtown Lafayette**. This move marks an exciting chapter for our company as we continue to grow and serve our clients in the heart of Lafayette, LA.

### Why the Move?

Our new location at 617 S Buchanan St positions us in the vibrant downtown area, a hub of business activity and community life. As a company rooted in Lafayette, we’re thrilled to be part of the continued revitalization of downtown and to contribute to the energy that makes this city so unique. This move represents an exciting milestone for Scout Real Estate Co. — we are proud to announce that we have purchased this building as our new permanent home, transitioning from leasing to ownership. This investment reflects our confidence in the growth and future of Lafayette and our commitment to establishing deep roots in the community we proudly serve. Owning our own space not only allows us to better serve our clients but also aligns with our long-term vision of growth and stability.

### Continued Commitment to Excellence

While our address is changing, our commitment to providing exceptional service and expertise in commercial real estate remains the same. Whether you are looking to lease, buy, or sell commercial property, Scout Real Estate Co. will continue to be your trusted partner. Our team of dedicated professionals is ready to assist you with all your real estate needs from our new home.
