###### After months of diligent efforts by Jeff and Rex, along with LUS Fiber Director Michael Soileau, Mayor-President Monique Boulet, and the executive team at the Lemoine Company, it is our great privilege to announce this transformative new tenant to Downtown Lafayette.

<br>LUS Fiber will now be leasing the 2 top floors of the former Lemoine Company Headquarters at 214 Jefferson St.<br>Rex, Jeff and all of Scout want to welcome LUS Fiber into the Downtown community!

With The Louisiana Physical Therapy Board also officially leasing part of the 1st floor, this leaves only 6,300 SF of prime ground-floor space still available for lease.

Additionally, the entire building is listed for sale, presenting a unique opportunity for investors or owner-occupants looking to secure a signature downtown property.
