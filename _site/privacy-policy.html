                We may disclose information about you to third parties as part of any merger, acquisition, sale, or financing agreement.

                We also implement and maintain appropriate technical and operational controls (including encryption and access control measures) to protect your personal information while it is stored on our systems. With that said, please note that no system or data transmission is ever completely secure. While we make all reasonable efforts to protect the confidentiality of the information we collect about you, we make no guarantees, representations, or warranties with respect to the security of your personal information during storage or transmission.
                
                Most of the information we collect about you is associated with your Website user account. To help protect your account, we encourage you to use a strong password that is unique to your use of our Website, never share your password with anyone, never store your password in an insecure location or manner, and logout of your account when you are finished using our Website. If you suspect that your password may have been compromised or that your account has been used in an unauthorized manner, we recommend you change your account password immediately.

            </p>

            <ul>

            <h4>The Right to “Opt Out” of the Sale of Your Personal Information</h4>

            <p>Under the CCPA, you may also request that your personal information not be sold to any third parties.

          </div>
          
          <div class="mb-7">

            <p>We have undertaken extensive steps to identify whether any of our data sharing arrangements would constitute the “sale” of personal information under the CCPA. We continue to maintain that we do not sell, trade, rent or otherwise disclose personal information to a third party for “monetary or other valuable consideration” and, therefore, are not required to provide you the ability to “opt out” of the sale of your information since we do not engage in such activities.</p>
