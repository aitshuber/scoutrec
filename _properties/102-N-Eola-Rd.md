Approximately 3.28 acres (more or less) of on the corner of Highway 90 and N Eola Road in Broussard with great potential for commercial visibility with easy access onto Highway 90.There is currently a house on piers and a sub-station for Acadian Ambulance. There is no value given to the home and trailer. Acadian Ambulance sub-station is on a year-to-year lease, expiring in October. Seller is reserving the work shed which seller will relocate. Acreage is approximate and must be confirmed by the buyer. The property is partially in City of Broussard limits and partially in an unincorporated part of Lafayette Parish.
