Highly visible commercial lot fronting Chemin Metairie Pkwy less than a quarter mile from the Youngsville Sports Complex and less than a mile from the heart of Youngsville including Sugar Mill Pond development. Youngsville ranks in the top 5 fastest growing communities in the state of Louisiana year in and year out. You are minutes from Lafayette and Broussard surrounded by thousands of homes all within a 2 mile radius. Owner willing to entertain build-to-suit-scenario.Detention is handled off site.Lot 5A is part of a larger commercial lot 5 of commercial park with deed restrictions and design requirements. Lot 5 will be subdivided into two smaller lots, lot 5A &amp; lot 5B to accommodate a future public road that will connect Chemin Metairie Parkway to a future residential subdivision in the rear of lot 5 called Rosewalk.
