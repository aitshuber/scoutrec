This extremely spacious two/three bedroom duplex apartment occupies a desirable position to the South-West of Harrogate's town centre and offers a huge amount of scope to update and re-model to suit the individual including a large eaves storage room ripe for conversion into a second bathroom.
Accessed via a communal hall up to the first floor, the apartment opens into a split level hall. To the front elevation there is a lovely, light and airy lounge with far reaching views towards the town centre and countryside beyond. Adjoining there is a well proportioned double bedroom with a fitted wardrobe.
