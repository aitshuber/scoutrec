Professional downtown office with high visibility, easy access and loads of on-site parking. Centrally located on the corner of Lee Ave. &amp; E. Main St. next to the Municipal Apartments makes this office a convenient walk to anywhere downtown. Very functional floor plan for a professional organization with (5) offices, (2) large co-lab workrooms, lobby, kitchen, (2) restrooms &amp; rear courtyard (See attached floor plan &amp; survey). Interior is in excellent condition with a combination of original oak wood, carpet and tile floors. Large windows and LED lights provide for great interior lighting. Plentiful outdoor space with a rear courtyard and front bench seating. Accent lighting provides an eye pleasing nighttime appearance. Owner will consider leasing 1,800 s.f. of the total 2,400 s.f. and retain the 600 s.f. co-lab suite on the right-side for the owner's use.
