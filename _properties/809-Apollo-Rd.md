Come and join PJ's Coffee and Dr. Ian Fontenot, DDS as a new member of the Shops at West Village, a single story multi-tenant commercial retail building located in West Village, the latest mixed use master planned community in Scott, Louisiana, part of Lafayette Parish. The Shops at West Village is just one of many commercial sites in this 150 acre community called West Village which will house over 600 families all within walking distance of this site. Already several phases in, West Village is another premier development created by the developers of the award winning Village of River Ranch, and if that weren't enough to excite you, perhaps the 30,000 plus cars a day passing in front of this site along the brand new Apollo Road extension project will. This latest major arterial project will connect Lafayette to Interstate 10 which is just a mile from this site.
