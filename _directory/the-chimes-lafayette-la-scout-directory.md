  The Chimes Finally Opens in Lafayette!


  Great news for Lafayette diners! The Chimes, a beloved restaurant known for
  its delicious Southern cuisine and vibrant atmosphere, has finally opened a
  new location in our city. This much-anticipated arrival was facilitated by
  Diana Stephens of Scout Real Estate, who successfully closed the deal to bring
  this popular eatery to Lafayette.


  The Chimes has earned a stellar reputation for its diverse menu, featuring
  mouthwatering dishes such as seafood platters, po'boys, and an extensive
  selection of local beers. With its warm, inviting ambiance and commitment to
  quality, it has become a favorite dining spot in its other locations.


  Stephens' successful negotiation is a significant win for our community,
  offering not only incredible food but also a new venue for gatherings with
  family and friends. The Chimes is also known for its community engagement,
  frequently participating in local events and supporting neighborhood
  initiatives.


  Be sure to visit the new Chimes location in Lafayette and indulge in their
  fantastic Southern fare and welcoming environment!
